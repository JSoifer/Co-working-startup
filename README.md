## Inspiration/Planning:
>Here are some images illustrating my inspiration and brainstorming session.  I really love the simplicity and image heavy design of Dovetail's website. I think a modern and clean color scheme with dark woods and black/charcoal offset with blush, mint, and soft blues would compliment the company's design esthetic and look beautiful in digital display.
